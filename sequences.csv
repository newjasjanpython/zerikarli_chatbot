Okay. Okay.,"No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours."
Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief."

You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold."

What?,"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?"
"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.","Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."

"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.","Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."

"Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. Its spreading already.","Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad."
Why havent you told them?!,Because they dont know were dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
"I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me.",That is nice and were done. TADA!
I made that joke up.,What?
Is that a swing?,Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.

Awesome.,"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean."
Do you have any ideas?,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!"

"No reason, except she told me.",Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.,Come on! It wasnt that bad!
"Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im still Toby.","Well, why dont you correct him?"
"I love you, St. Valentine.","Yeah, just relax."
Bamboozled?,All right! Lets play Bamboozled!
What?! Why does she think that?,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
"Okay, something to cover the smell ... Ovencleaner! Unscented!",I'm gonna go.
"Hear me out, woman! Ill go down the fire escape, then Ill wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, itll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.",Yes. Because all good plans start with Ill just go down the fire escape 
What? That's terrible!,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What?,"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.",I want a baby.
"You know, our band is playing on Friday.","Hey, Missy..."
I'm so sorry...,Honey.
"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.","Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
You understood that?,Consider it done.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
Chandler. _B_,I'm Gail.
How do you not fall down more?,"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men."
"All right, rock on. _B_","Great. Ill ah, see ya then."
"What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!!","Hey-hey, check out the hat!"
Nooo.,What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
"Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...","You're kidding! Oh, I love him."
Hes really picky about his patients.,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend!"
I thought it was $98.50.,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
Stop that now!,Well be starting with apples.
"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?""",Can you hear anything?
"Oh, that was my work laugh.",That noise you just made?
"Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.","I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?"
"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. _B_","Oh, So you can move them!"
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,OK. Oh Monica! Guess what! _B_
"Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids.","Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth."
"Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood. Hey!","If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay. _B_"
"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?","Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
Dude that is so sad.,Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.
"Sorry, I just cant sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like","Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up."
I have no idea.,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So hows the game?"
"I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.","Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M."
"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?","I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
"Woah, woah, thats not pretty! Man on","I love you, St. Valentine."
You really want to take me?,Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr!
What? May I?,"If you want to check your email, just ask!"
What? May I?,"If you want to check your email, just ask!"
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.,"Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.,Hi...
Hi!,I got them! _B_
"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.","This is my father, this is a picture of my dad."
"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page. _B_",You got a problem with that?
"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.","No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. All right. _B_","Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star."
Yes!,Stop that now!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,What?
"Yeah, I know that means buddy!","And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!"
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!,You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?
"Oh, tell her good luck with that.","Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."
Right.,"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people."
"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.","Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?"
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?,"All right, what about the third guy?"
"No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling me Muriel.",Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Who cares? Its a stupid game.,Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
"Again, what?!",Because it kinda looked like I did.
"No thanks, I'm good.",Welcome home. I've missed you. join mein the bedroom?
Just gonna wait for a little while.,Arent you afraid that Joeys going to figure all this out? _B_ I heard it! _B_
"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.","No-no, we do it every year!"
Ah!,Ross says hi.
"Ok, ok, here we go.","Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!"
"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.",Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
What do you think Pheebs?,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife? _B_,"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue."
You got it.,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?"
"What? _B_ Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.","I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you."
"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir? _B_ MRS.","I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?"
"All right. ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married!","Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'"
"Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.","Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. All right. _B_"
"Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married.","Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. Im gonna, Im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!"
"Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",Well?!
I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!,Oh. What do you do?
"So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.",Oh please!
Yes. _B_,Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
"I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" And it starts right now!","In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.",Really? Your work laugh?
Sure!,"Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?,I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
"Hey-hey, is Monica here?",Yknow what
You look great!,Hey!
Okay.,"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
"Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.","Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips."
Could I play? _B_,I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
What?! Ow! _B_,It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?,You take your time.
"This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.","Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours."
You'll get one.,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have to help out with stuff.,What?
No!,Yeah!
So youre never actually going to pay me back?,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
"I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_",Careful. Careful.. CAREFUL!
Okay Buckwheat!,"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!",We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Joe...,"Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in."
I was in the car with Nancy all day.,Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Damn it.,"You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.","Yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time."
"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.","Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. _B_"
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
And then Tineals.,"All right, we have to pick captains."
"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!",Yes. _B_
Diet soda.,"Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt."
"Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.","Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, theyre hanging out with Joey."""
"Well, what did the police say?",Someone at work ate my sandwich!
It is starting to get dark out there.,"That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy."
Yeah lets head off to work.,"Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 1130 on a Wednesday."
"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_","Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs."
Im not macho.,Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.
"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the ""a-gogo.""","Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
"Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that!","Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?"
"You said no, right?","Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too."
"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
"Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" hes thinking, ""Yeah, Id do her too!""",Can you blame him?
Shh! It is a family name!,"Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!"
I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.,You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! Woman on,Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
"Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.","Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet."
"Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.",Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!
As we all are at some point during the day.,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…"
"Right. You know what? Actually I just getoff the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take ashower.","O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?"
Wait a minute. This isn't the china we picked out...,"I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_"
Its huge! _B_ _B_,Scary pigeons back?
"Well, now, I actually have to get to work.","This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.,Ok.
Ok.,I'll let you get acquainted.
Yeah.,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.","So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
"Wait, wait, wait. _B_ _B_","Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?"
"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. _B_",It's not that bad.
I can't believe she's married.,Well at least we know she's a woman.
Sure. Ummm. Whats up?,"Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions?"
"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.","Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out."
"Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I dont belong here.""","Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?"
Okay.,"All right, check me out."
"Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.","Oh wait, my grandmother's dead."
"No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man.",Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!","Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much."
"so then the farmer says, ""Thats not a cow and youre not milking it.""","Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_"
"Oh, are we playing this?!",Its your turn.
You okay over there?,"Oh, thanks."
Centerpieces!,Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
And your friend Phoebe?,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",Oh yeah? When?
"OK, so now we draw cards.",No. _B_
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,I dont believe you! That is brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
And a bagel with only,"Uh, double latte, extra foam."
"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!","Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",It's not the time Charlie.
"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",It's not the time Charlie.
Fine!,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!"
"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!",Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Fresh!,Right. I'll be there.
"So, basically just a Chinese guy.",Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",But don't you need experience for a job like that?
"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.","...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories."
"We dont, really.","Hey, how do you guys get anything done?"
"Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?","Ohh, thank you."
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
Orange juice.,Yes. Yes. Yes.
"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.","Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there."
Condoms?,"Ooh, Madlibs, mine!"
"Ross, it's just a sandwich!",My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!",This is so cool!
Oh hi!,Hey everyone!
"No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a crying kind of guy.",Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.
"Okay, look I need your help, I dont know what to get her for Valentines Day.",No.
"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",Career counselor?
"You said no, right?!",Huh?
Yeah!,Well then we still have a problem.
I am trying! _B_,Ohhh! Make it stop!
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?,"Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more."
I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.,"Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself."
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!","Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... _B_"
"Alright, the truth is, I soiled myselfduring some turbulences.",You don't need a shower.
Why?,I know! After you left the store I chose different ones.
Okay.,"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
That's what our friends call us.,"So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D."
You're kidding!,She died.
"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?","You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. _B_ That's actually good. _B_","Chandler, Chandler."
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
What gay thing?,"Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing."
Hello.,Hey!
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
"Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.","He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."
"Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules","And its not fake, its totally brutal."
Is it on?,Oh-oh-oh-oh!
"You mean like, music? _B_","What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear."
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!,says $30 Father; same as in town. _B_
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.,"Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative."
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely.""",No.
"Look at us, were a couple of couples!","I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!"
Hey! Howd the audition go?,Hey.
"Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. _B_","I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No, yknow what? Never mind, Im gonna be fine."
"Definitely roses. Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.",Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? _B_","Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!"
"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit. _B_ Dr.","Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Yeah! Anderson just scored again! Theres no Anderson.,Is your team winning hon?
Why do you want to play this game so bad?,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card?"
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
"Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!","I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?"
"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.","Oh no, we have to!"
"Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.","You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!","Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?"
"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!","Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?"
"Work, Joe!",Thank you.
It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.,So? What do you think of the house?
Mint!,Boss!
"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.","_B_ Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections."
"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?","Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me."
"Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.","You mean like, music? _B_"
"Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.","Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious."
"Shhh, busy beaming with pride. Mrs.",Your mom was arrested?
And condoms are the way to do that? _B_,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.","Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?",All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey!,On a totally different bet.
"Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry.","Come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
She was working on Valentines Day so were celebrating it tonight.,"Well, Valentines Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldnt get her a calendar!"
"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",I don't!

"And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.",Really?
Hi!,"All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stopped loving you."
"Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!","Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like youd believe that. This sucks!"

"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?","Oh wait a second you guys for the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus.

"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.","Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?"
Really?,"Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble."
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?,"...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man..."
"Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?","That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything."

Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!,I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.

"Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.",Where is the James Taylor CD?
Get there faster! _B_,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
"OK, Pheebs, your turn.","No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?","Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter."
"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...","Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...","Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
Tell me more.,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it."
"Yes, Joe?","Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute..."
"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.","Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?"
"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",Have you ever seen so much crap?
"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",Really?
"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",Right this is staging.
"I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.","What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?"
"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",Is Brian...?
"Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.","Yeesh, whatd you do about it?"
"Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he says hes sorry.","Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more"
"Hello. Its Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.",Okay.
"No, hes right, Im totally lying.",Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?,Yes it is. See.
"Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?",Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around",What do you mean?
"Hey, look at all the boxes!","Oh, so you like her too Chandler?"
"Oh well, that makes it not terrible.","No-no, we do it every year!"
"Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!","Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!"
Here you go.,"Uh sorry, wrong number."
Hey!,Hey!
Fine.,"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go."
"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?","Honey, whats going on?"
"Yeah, thats kinda a relief.",Thats kinda nice.
What?,A little tall.
Yep. Ms.,"Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler, Chandler?"
"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.",Ohhh! Put it out!
You'll get one.,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
I know. Gooooood luck with it. _B_,Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Your hands are shaking.,"Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?"
Forget about her.,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?",How did you...
"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.",And she's not crazy?
"_B_ Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK. _B_ MR.",Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
That's right my friend. It's time for...,Well OK then. _B_ Was that the oven timer?
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?","Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
...Hm.,I suppose mainly sexual.
"Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.",Hes so cute.
"Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!! _B_",Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey!,Hey!!
"Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship","Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails."
"Aah, y'killing me!","Nice shoes, huh?"
"No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.",Have you even had a girl up here?
"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! _B_","No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
I'm over here big guy.,"It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?","Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
"Yeah, it is the best.","I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
Okay.,"Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had."
Yes.,"But we can go, right?"
Hes at a dinner party.,"Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?"
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.","Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer."
"Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.",He hates to lose.
"No, I am.","Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?"
"Hi, Nina. Come on in.",Hi.
No I didn't!,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
"Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?","Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .","Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job."
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!,"Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!"
You have to really wanna see it. _B_,How is that the silver lining?
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!,"Look, look, I have elbows! _B_"
Bye. _B_,Bye-bye.
"Alright you guys are off to party number one _B_ and you, you are off to party number two _B_ Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",_B_ This is clearly in the wrong apartment. _B_ _B_
Hello-dillillio!!,Chandler!
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not. _B_,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
"Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.","Y'know what, I like Kathy."
"So I guess its just uh, you and me then.",Oh.
"Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.",What happened?
"Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.",Then what is it?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. Mrs.,I am famished. What do I want...
Horn-swoggle.,"That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.","Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this."
"Y'know, I don't see that happening?","Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
"Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone. _B_","That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we.","Uh, we might be leaving now."
"This, this actually is a","Now, its you little bunny friend. _B_"
Thats sweet.,"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she she wished me good luck."
Yes!,Noo!!!
"Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.","So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
I dont think you did a very thorough job!,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school

How long it took to go back in the water?,Mm-hmm.
You wanna see if we still have it?,Yeah.
Its just so glamorous. _B_,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go."
Yes. Ms.,Are you on board?
"What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.","Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow ."
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness,Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",Oh yeah? When?
"Course there, they just call it food.","He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. _B_",Thanks.
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
"So, we gettin' a fish?",Bye. _B_
"You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car _B_.","Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. _B_ Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats _B_."
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!","Hey, you know about that?!"
"Okay, but after that, were shootin some pool.","Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt."
Okay. Its a chicken.,I got you something! Open it! Open it!
"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.","Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,"I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?,"""My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."""

It's a great idea.,Okay!
Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_,I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
"No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!","Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?"
Yeah!,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"

"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! _B_","Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. _B_ _B_"
Does anybody know me?!,Youre not a lefty?

Hey Phoebe! Fatty!,Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.","Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.,Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.","Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this."
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.,"Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?"
"Ok, they're coming, shhh. _B_",Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? _B_ Alright that's Ross.
"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",I-I know. Well if something comes up...
"Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.","Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob."
"All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",I know. _B_
"She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?","Yeah, she's..."

"No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.",And youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes.
"Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?",Come on!
"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.","Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?"
Love what you've done with the place.,Hey roomies!
"No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.",You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
What's going on?,Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Hi.,Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.',"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
Hey.,Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_
"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?","Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her."
"Ok, you can not do this to me.","She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
Was his question whats more boring than him?,"Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut."
"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentines Day gifts?",Hey!

What?,I dont think this numbers right!
Hey.,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? _B_"
"Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, ""If it helps!""","Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!"
You dont know. You didnt see it.,"Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!"
FREE PORN!!!,Yeah.
Yeah?,"Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?"
Yes dear.,We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Sure! Alright...,"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else? Monica &"
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!,"Oh, man!"
Yuh-huh.,Nuh-uh.
I think they get it.,No problem. Hey Chandler

"Hello, children!","Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
"I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!","Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?","Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now."
"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?",Why not?
"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.","Yeah, I can do that."
"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.","Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
"No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live here too.",But we have to!
Okay .,"Well, Im not going to go now anyway ."
And he's not speaking metaphorically.,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
Okay.,"Yeah! All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy."
"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.","Which is bad, because?"

"Well, we are great guys.",I think it's great you guys are doing this.
"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?","Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Bleeth."

"Oh, the tears are real. _B_","You're fake laughing too, right?"
Sounds like a fun party.,"so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy!

Why would you say that?,"Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?"
"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",Oh. _B_
"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?","If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so."
"Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
"Yeah all right, so well hang out.",430.
"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?","You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell her what I did."
"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.","Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think any of them are gonna work out."

"Im sorry man, theres never a good time to stop catching on fire.","Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I gotta be careful?!"
You dont even have a car!,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound."
"Hi! Im back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, well do it then. Okay, bye-bye.","When youre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?"
"Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow",Why?

"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",Yeah?
Whos that?,This one is uh Paul ONeil.
"Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.

So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Oh come on!,Oh okay.
"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?","I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
What?!,Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.
"Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?",Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?","Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
"Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!","Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. _B_"
"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.","I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
"Okay, the old hug and roll.","Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.","I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me?,Chandler!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,They say he's only got half a tank left.
Ow!,That's not possible!
Hey!,"And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross. _B_"
"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! _B_","Oh yes of course, hello Chandler."
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,"So, do we have the best friends or what?"
"He took my joke, he took it.","She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
Okay!,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
We cant accept this.,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
"Oh no-no, I cant do that.","Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?"
Joe,Well then let me do it!
Okay. Heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.,"Honey, we gotta go!"
Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!,"Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, Im a potato or a spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes Spud-nik. Spudnik!"
Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!"
They do me?,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
On every word?,Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.","So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,Hello? Hi.
Who said anything about Christmas? _B_,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas."
"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. _B_ Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . _B_ wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. _B_","Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
"All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.","Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."

When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing speedosThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!","Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know"
She mustve been planning this for years!,Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!

"Yes, include more people in this.","I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does."
"All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.",Bet I know how that discussions going to go. _B_
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
Hey Joe!,This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. _B_
I don't sound like that.,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?","Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?"
"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!","Dude, two times that happened!"
"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",Needs some clothes altered?
"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. _B_","All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon."
"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . _B_ _B_ MR.",You know what the. . . _B_
But...,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
Why not?!,"No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant."
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?,"No, no, no, actually losers rhyme. _B_"
"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...",She was kidding about that right?
I wanna quit the gym. Gym,You do realize that you wont have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
Kay.,Checking to see if its even.
"All right, I'm nine years old.","Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
"Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.",Someone you didnt make up!
"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. _B_ Mrs.","Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book."
"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?","Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up."
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,Yeah?
There you are. _B_,And six others.
We didnt get to the audition. Im gonna take her to coffee and then well do it then.,Hey!
"Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.",Sup? Sup dude?
"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?",You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
What is it doing here?,"No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room."
"I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.","So, can I get some candy?"
"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.","Okay. But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch."
Are you serious?,Uh-huh.
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!,"Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad."
"Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore.","Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better."
What is it that I do?,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shhh!"
"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",Hey!
"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?","What are you doing here, Santa?"
What happened?,"Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it."
Great! This baby'd better be really good. _B_,"Oh yeah, let's do that!"
"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!",What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",Hey.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right? _B_,Shoot.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.,Tah-daaah!
"Okay. Yes. Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!","No, we are. Im sad."
"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.","Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!"
"Man, didnt she like just get here?","Ugh, shes saying good-bye to her uncle."
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!","I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
I said art lover.,What'd you say?
"Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official, were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?","I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and shes the only one left!"
"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know... _B_",Each.
Yeah!,Thats a good idea.
Our guy smells incredible.,My guy has great teeth!
"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",My God! What happened to you?
"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.",Okay.
"Well, thank you for lunch.",Well see. _B_
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.,"Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting married?"
"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.",...Yeah.
Oh my God.,So?
"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.","...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,Hey!
And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,"Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’."
No reason. _B_,"Yeah, why?"
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
What is the thing?,"Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
Hike! Monica and,Yeah!
"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?","Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?","God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.","Yeah, but dont you think...."
Thanks.,"Okay. Yes. Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!"
Oh the phone! The phones making sounds! Hello!,Looks good.
"I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.","Oh my God, is it really that bad?"
"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.","Oh, I hate this story."
Wh-wh-why?!,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head."
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is! _B_,"No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!"
"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",What's up?
"Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?",We are so gonna find them this year.
"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",Can I help you?
"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.","So youre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thats whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation, sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!"
"Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me. _B_","Well, apparently she does."
"Hey, where you been?","Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?"
007?! This is James Bonds tux?!,Yeah.
Does it matter?!,Whos Mr. Garibaldi?
"So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch?",I guess.
What are you doing?!,"Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you."
Did you like me when we first met?,"Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy."
"I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.","How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that adwith a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling."
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.,Was your cabin pressurised?
What?,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
So what does this mean?,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?","You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it! _B_"
"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!,"Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four."
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before."
Where are they? Where are they?,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. _B_
Well there you go.,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay. _B_","Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
There he is!,"No, Im good. _B_"
"See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?","Op, I like credit cards!"
"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey.","Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its like yknow, Chanoey?"
Easy tiger.,Yeah!! Yeah!
Uh-huh.,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
Well it's not flexed right now! _B_,This bicep?
"I don't know, I'm very tired.",Is that supposed to be an insult?
Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.,No.
Picking Rachel.,Do you know whats a bad idea?
"Honey, it is not a date! I havent talked to her in ten years! You cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.","Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl?"
Hey.,Do you want our guy to be your guy? _B_
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.",That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
"Okay, we owe you a present.",Yeah! I bet I can do it.
"No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebes secret?",Oh my God. He threw up?
"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!","Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!"
So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?,"What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!"
"Yknow, we havent found anybody else.","Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."
Hi! Nice to meet you!,I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Well you dont have to sound so surprised.,"I just, I cant believe that we made it!"
We are on our honeymoon.,Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our honeymoon.
Im going to need a bigger boat. _B_,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!"
Whats wrong with you?,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose! _B_ _B_"
She answered.,How many beeps?
And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
"I mean, you have a lovely home.","So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
"Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?","What are these, like famous chickens?"
What?,"Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
"Oh, hey.","Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
She was kidding.,"Dude, I dont know."
Okay.,"No, no, that was my boss. I have to go."
I wanna quit the gym.,"Sorry, members only."
Hey its Joey!,"Hey dude, its me."
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. _B_,Oh my god.
"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!","Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
How do you figure that?,"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",Sure. Okay.
"You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? Phoebe and",Yeah.
"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.","Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
"Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!","Come on man, really how old?!"
Score.,"I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries."
How do you know so much about this?,"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!"
"Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!",Yeah.
"Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.","Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life."
"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.
All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So
Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.,So what? Don't you have any will power?
"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?",Okay.
"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.","No, I think we killed it. _B_"
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,"uhu uhu, check this out."
"M-Me, me, me!",I'll do it!
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!,Rachel used to live in that room.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?","Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
"Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.","Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel."
"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.","Well, so what does he do?"
"Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.","All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right? Its a stupid, stupid non-name!"
So what are you going to do?,"I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, ""Well, Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
Yeah.,Chandler!
Hey.,Hey!
Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,Thats right. Did you hear something?
"No, we only went out once.","Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youre yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
"Well, you dont look good Joe.",Huh.
"But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story Youre roommate in college died didnt he?","Oh, you dont have to do that every time."
"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? Male","This ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side."
Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?,"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired."
Really?,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"
Mm! Night Gar! _B_,Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.,Its still there!
What?,Im sorry but nothing.
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious."
"This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath","No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question."
"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.","Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",What are you doing?
"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?","I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!","Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
What? What do you mean you know?,"Yeah, I know."
"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.",'My scones.'
"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!","Well, I hope you're happy!"
"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!","Well, I hope you're happy!"
"OK, this one right here is from me.","Well, thank you, Melanie."
What did you just do?,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok."
"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.","Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?"
So whaddya got there Monica?,She told us.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.,"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?"
"Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.",They were in his office.
"Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.",I almost caught that one!
"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.",Yeah.
Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.,Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.,"So, so, whatd ya think?"
Im getting dressed.,What are you doing?
What?,"Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnt there!"
Hey Joe.,Oh.
"Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",Its this way? Sorry. _B_
"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! Im right. I'm right. Am I right?","Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.","Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
You mean scared.,"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy."
"Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store that Ive never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! _B_","No, we never do that"
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.","Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
Joe?,Wow thanks!
"Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...",She is so hot!
"Richard used to do it, didn't he?",I don't know.
Yeah you can do it.,So I can do it?
"Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this? _B_",Its a pretty cool tux.
So I really never get to win anymore?,Yes!
"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?","Alright boys, let's eat."
And Joey.,Yeah!
"'kay,",You said that was sexy!
"Yeah, he came up...","No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
"No, come on, you know that's not true.","Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up! _B_","Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
"You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump. _B_","Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!"
"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.",You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
. Well played.,Joey's bare ass!
Here we go.,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
Weird world. Your kids?,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?","Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left."
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!,"Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake. _B_"
"Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive ever met in a mens room.",I ran!! _B_
"Its a big company, I dontif youI",Your company has a fine foods division?
Okay.,"Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im sorry."
"I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. _B_","Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
What are you doing?,Hey.
"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.","Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel."
You know Oh My God.,Whats up?
Not once!,You dated her!
Thats still in there?!,"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?"
"Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much is it?",Okay. Will you marry me?
"Well, it still has to go, right? Monica and","Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"
"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
Honestly? Me too.,Well honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to.. to flip you out.
Hey! Did you find the cameras?,Chandler?

"Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, Im Chandler.","Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit."
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.",No?
Hi! How are you? s office.,Yeah!
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,Why not?
"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good?",What?!
"Hey, man!",Hey!
Flashdance.,There was a seen in Footloose...
"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever read Flowers for Algernon?","Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, lets trade! The timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet!"
What?!,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!"
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.,Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?","I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
"Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then theres a definite sign that we should get married.","Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!"
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.","Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,"Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
Okay.,"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a CokeDiet Coke. _B_",Hey Joe!
"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!","Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!"
Ill take a card.,"Choose, you jackass!"
Hello? Hello?,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?"
And no kissing your neck.,"Huh, and no cuddling."
Enunciate!,Sure...
Hey Joe!,Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]
"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.",Oh! It's not good.
F-hah.... flennin....,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles Would you knock it off? Bah! Commercial Break _B_","So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!","Okay. All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand! _B_"
"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. _B_","It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
"So uhh, how's the palace?",Hey.
"Ok, that's me. _B_",Dennis.
"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.","I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
"Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.","I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here."
"I dont know. I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.","Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?"
"All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.
"Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying this!","Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face."
OhI don't know.,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?"
It was my racquet.,I was frustrated.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.,"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it."
"Glass, sand, whatever.",What?!
"Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.","Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
"Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you. _B_",Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?,Oh hi!
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",Hey!
nan,"Well, its a funny story."
That was her.,How about the place settings?
Shh! Nice to see you again. Airline,Oh my God! Oranges!
Were on a semi-first name basis. Mr.,Oh then you know each other.
"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!","Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it."
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,"I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard."
Joey said that youre in here with another man!,What are you saying?
You do? That's fantastic!,I have a badge in it.
Of course it was!,Yes!
I know. He has your eyes.,"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!"
I know. He has your eyes.,"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!"
Hey.,Hey.
"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!","No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. Rachel and","Honey, this will help."
Thanks,Here you go.
Youre our age!,Okay.
How little?!,Im really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
"I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.",Can you really do that?
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom. Commercial Break _B_",Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
She was a welder.,"Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl"
"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.","Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
"So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?",Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh . _B_
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!,"Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back."
Sounds great.,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married."
We dont have to come up with this now.,Totally!
No! No! No! Noone can beat me.,"Okay, here we go. Ready? _B_"
What'?,"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren."
"Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words.",What is the matter with your hand?
So how's Mindy?,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God.

And lots of kissing your neck. _B_,"Oh good, I hate it when you do that"
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.,What's up?
"Yeah, wow.",Wow.
Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,I decided to pee.
That is a bad interview.,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.",I know. He has your eyes.
"Oh, no-no-no-no-no....",Oh.... my God.
"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.",I know. He has your eyes.
"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",Have you been here all night?
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.,"Hey, hey, look at that talent."
"Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.",You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.","Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. _B_"
Excuse me?,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?","Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"""
What?,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!"
"Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon! Commercial Break _B_","Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!"
"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef. Fat",Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.,I was frustrated with you!
Oh my God!,That was my dad!
"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?","Well, it involved Monica."
Really?!,Really?!
"See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. _B_",No! No! No! Noone can beat me.
"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",Why not?
As crazy as soccer?,Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?

Okay.,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on."
And here we go,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!"
"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.",Its awfully pink. _B_
This game is kinda fun.,What?!
"Ahh, merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",You wanna see it?
RAT BASTARD!,"Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't."
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
Wait-wait-wait-wait!,Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Well this one's for you.,How come you have two?
"Well, there you go.","Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."

She has a real name.,Nana?
"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.","Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands..."
Screw the Knicks!,Its the Knicks!
Your work makes me sad.,Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,Oh and you know what I want!
"Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you","I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that."
What-what Richard thing?,"Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing."
"Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?",Oh good.
"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!","Really, ythink so? I dont.. Commercial Break _B_"
Because its awesome.,"Chandler, why would you do that?"
Whats he doing?,"Alright, alright. Then maybe you wont mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at? _B_"
I'm sorry man.,Oh.
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!"
Okay.,We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Okay.,We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.","Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
"Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.","Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?"
"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.","That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say."
Don't play with his things.,"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. _B_"
Then I got all needy and clingy.,That is never good.
Bye-bye.,"All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys."
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!,What?
For three years?,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?","Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!"
Its the theme from Good Will Humping.,Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long.
"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight. _B_","Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
"More coffee over here, please! Commercial Break _B_","Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"

"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",Noooooooo! _B_
I am proud of all my friends today.,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year."
You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?,"Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind youre gonna like."
You mean you didnt get it from this?,"Hello? What are you talking about? The auditions not til 500! Well, nobody told me! Whod you talk to? Nevermind!"
"And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!! _B_",It hurts my teeth.
Oh my God!,It sounds like its coming from across the street.
"Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A. Airline","Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number."
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. Mr.,Really? They love him down on six.
"Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres something wrong.",Hello?

"Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!","But, ehm... you watched the tape?"
Not for me it doesn’t. Agency,Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.

What does she do?,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
What are you guys doing out here?,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.",Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!

"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
I got nothing. _B_,I'm adopted?
How do you feel?,I'm really happy for you guys.

That's what they'll call us. _B_,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
I want you to say that you like her!,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
"Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.",How ya feelin?

"Yes, yes eight.",Come on eight.
Is that a problem?,Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?

"Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?","Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I cant do it. I cant do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! _B_"
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.,Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever propose!
What happened? Im just eating candy.,"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!"
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,IN LONDON!!!
Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.,"Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun."
It is when you put it together with that one.,"Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty."
What problem did you tell him you had?,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?",Really!
What!? Of course I did!,You didn't watch the tape.
"Uh, Rach?","Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing."
"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?",Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
How do you know that? How?,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",Yeah?
There was no fish when she dropped it off.,"My fish, Buddy."
"That, that's what's stupid.","It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
Oh God.,Ohh!
"You tell me! Maybe, its because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",Why are your eyes so white?
You really think that is what he meant?,"What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!"
"Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.","Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?"
"Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I dont think so mister!","Ohhh, here it comes."
"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.","He is right, isnt he?"
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?","No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination."
"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",Yeah!
"Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.","Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off."
I'm not mad.,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",Thank you. Uh...
"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.","Chandler, please, come on. Look at him."
"I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.","Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something crazy!"
"I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up.",How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my whole career around!
"Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening. Yeah we are. The Museum","Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen. _B_"
"Mr. D, hows it going, sir? Mr.",Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower. _B_
Yeah? I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room. _B_,You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as were both up
See? Here we go. Mr.,Yay!
Yes!! _B_ Commercial Break _B_,Nooo!!
Hi dad.,Hello all!
What size shoes do you wear?,"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people."
"Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. Mr.",But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!",Oh. Whats wrong?
Mento?,"Yeah, so far nothing stupid."
...And boogie!,Get down?
I send them home.,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. Where is everybody else?"
I - I don't think I can.,"So, let's do this."
"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though. _B_",What was that?
"Actually, we already found a house we love.","It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",Phoebe here with the cab yet?
"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.",Wow.
You had to ask.,The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!","I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee? Commercial Break _B_,"Gunther, I quit."
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!,Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
Nice shooting!,Althea is correct.
"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...",No.
"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
"Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_",You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",No!
"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?","Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
"Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.","Well, its a set and they should probably stay together."
Hey!,Bastard! _B_
"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat.",How did that happen?!!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!,"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?"
Phoebe Buffay in,What?!!
"Okay, come here! Come here.","Sure! Okay, you go first."
Just tell her the truth! Tell her youre not ready.,"You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?"
"Absolutely! Yknow, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker.","Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it."
"My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!","Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, Im gonna kill myself! Ill get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing. _B_"
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
"Youre right, this is more fun.",How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
"Come on, he wont even know what they mean.","Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there."
"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!","Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency",Do you have any question for Erica?
"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?","I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
So how'd it go?,That was 14 hours ago.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie..._B_ Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? _B_ _B_,"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?"
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
All right!,Oh my God!!
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",Yeah.
And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?,Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
"Oh, no-","Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident."
"Oh-no, hes right. Commercial Break _B_",You think?
"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",What?!
"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.","Chandler, will you just come in already?"
"No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not an even trade.","Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?"
"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.","Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. Ross and","Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_"
"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.",Really?!
"That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.",Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.
That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here.,"Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then youre coming with me."
"Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_","Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!"
"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!! Commercial Break _B_","Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"
And? Mr.,"Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in."
Why is your family Ross?!,"No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!"
"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?","Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! _B_,Thats a good one.
The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different. Its interesting.,What?
"Nobody here, Joe.","Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier. _B_"
"Uhh, uh...","Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
Because of Emma.,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
"Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.",I really made you think about that thing uh?
You know it?,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. _B_","Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7."
"Oh, yeah?",I miss Rose.
"Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.","Oh, now it's a spare room?"
Hey!,Hey!
I spelled out boobies.,"....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?"
There you go!!,We use it!!
Yes!,Ohh!!
"Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.","Rachel, could I see you for a moment?"
"Well, like father, like son.",Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.","Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
Hello children!,"Ahhhhhhhhhh , and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.)"
"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?","Actually, I did!"
"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",See now-now youre taking them away from their home.
"Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?",Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
"Now, its not wrapped because I just, just finished it.",Okay!
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.,"I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
"You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!","Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_"
Have you talked to him lately?,Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid.
I can't believe you want us to raise Emma!,"Well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want Monica and Chandler."
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
I watched it!,"Well, you lied again!"
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency,"Yes, our system assures total anonymity. We’re very proud of it."
"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE","And about an hour ago, we made an offer."
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!,"Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow."
"Yeah, I understand.","Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
"Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.","Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?"

"I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?","Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant..."
"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.","Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.","Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
Thanks!,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hes Chandler!"
Damn Rollos!,"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! Commercial Break _B_"

"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.","Answer better, answer better!"

Hey.,"Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!"

"I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.",I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Guys?,"Daddy. All right look, heres the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and thats when it happened. _B_"

"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.","Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
Hey-hey!,Hey!
"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.","Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you."
What?! Why did you do that?,"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
"Look, Im not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youre not perfect! Youve made some errors in judgment too!","Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you! _B_"
"Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants!",Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
No. How are ya Paul?,Rachel?
"I know, but just let me say it.",Oh my God!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,"No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa . And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
"Okay, will you just go help her change please!",Maybe that will liven up this party.
"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?","Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
Well now-now youre just talking crazy.,"Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?"
"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",What did he tell you?
"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. Ill let myself out. _B_","Bing, what an unusual name."
"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!","Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!,"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe..."
"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.",Oh honey...
"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",That's a good point.
'Scuse me.,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! Commercial Break _B_"
_B_ Where's my seat belt?,"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet."
"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.","Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!,"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!"
They got a breakfast buffet.,Its 930 in the morning!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!,"Well, I do."
Hi!,Hey! Ross and
"Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.",I dont know how to play Cups.
Oh thats too bad.,"Oh, shes uh-uh really sick."
"I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.","Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thats what this is about."
Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things.,"Come on, its not that big a deal!"
"Oh its always nicer to hear than, ""Aw crap! You again!""","Hey! Good, youre home!"
"Yeah! No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.",Give me the good stuff.
Whend you meet her?,Yeah!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Well this one's for you.,How come you have two?
'S'why I'm dancing... _B_,Don't you have to pee?
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?,Hey.
Ye....,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,"if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.","Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
Twins! Twins!!,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?"
Twins! Twins!!,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?"
"Janice, you're","Hey, it's everybody."
Fine with me.,Well then maybe I will.
"Well, I'm going to kill you.","Joseph's good, isn't he?"
"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!",He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
He started mine first!,"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
"Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her. _B_","Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel bad man, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff."
Me! On my computer.,"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
"You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!","No, no, no, thats Dina."
"Your liking it, huh?",These little women. Wow!
"Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.","Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there."
Okay.,"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, shes going in."
"Now, theres two reasons.","Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!"
I sure did.,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Unfortunately that is correct. The,Viva Las Gaygas!
Monica. _B_,Chandler!
"Okay, so he's out of here.","Uh fellas,"
That's patio furniture!,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
I am now!,These arent for you! Are you upset?
"Hey Mon, how's it going?",Hi!
How could it not matter?!,"I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter."
What happened?!!,Name one! _B_
"No, did he hug you?!","Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?"
"What?! Im Chandler! Oh, thats Richard!","Oh my God, Richard."
"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with! _B_","No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me."
"Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?","Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
"Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.",Oh my God! That is so good!
Because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,So why cant the three of us go out together?
But what did he mean by rules?,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone."
Is it made of cheese?,"Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a great little villa you can stay at."
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?"
I personally could have a gallon of Alan. _B_,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.,Thanks.....
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?"
"Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.",What's going on?
"Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.","Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you."
"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! _B_","Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later."
"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.","It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied."
_B_ Hey!,"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. _B_"
_B_ All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. _B_ _B_,Ok. _B_
Could you get us a couple of beers? _B_ DR.,What's this.
"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!",Does it hurt?
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
"Yes, yes, we had the sex.","So, did you do it?"
"Ooh, let me talk to him!","Hello. Oh, hey Ross!"
Ah sure. What's in 'em?,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Hi!,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it. _B_"
"Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?",All right.
So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.,"Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction."
"Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!","My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I cant breathe."
"Oh, its okay. I dont","No! No, she doesnt. Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. They are completely differentOkay! Okay! Okay! I didnt make it! Im sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to make the presents!"
"Well, I have some.",How? I dont have any money.
Hey.,Hey baby.
Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!,Two days ago.
What?,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!"
"No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.",Get out.
"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",What? Whoo... What?
"I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?",I dont know what to say. We shouldnt have lied to you.
I'm serious!,Okay.
Hey!,Hey!
"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?","Chandler, you're panicking!"
"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?","Chandler, you're panicking!"
Is it,"Yes, I am."
Nice work my friend.,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray."
Why?,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
Oh my God!,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to..."
"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",Well you sure used a large font.
"Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.,"Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!"
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.,"Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
"Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",Why?
"Okay, fine, $300.","Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half."
"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.",I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
What about the birds?,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
"Okay, bye!",Hey roomie!
"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.","Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight."
What about all that friends forever stuff?,"How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!"
"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.","No! No! Its just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad."
I dont want him to tell this story for years.,"Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!"
Okay.,"Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?"
Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,"Good God Bing I well I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust."
Because he was looking at her differently.,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
"Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance. _B_",You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing,Oh I’m kinda part of this.
"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.","No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired."
"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!","I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on..."
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.","Oh, okay. _B_"
"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.",Who is being loud?
"Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.","Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
About what?,Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",The balloon?
"It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, Im all right with it.""","Uh-oh, it was bad?"
"Well, can I just","Oh-oh, my God!"
"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies! _B_","Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So"
"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.","Umm, cups."
"Yes I did, and I think you should do it.","Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
Hey!,Damn!
"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!",A two and a five.

Oh come on! Are you listening to this?,Id move in tomorrow!
That's what they'll call us. _B_ _B_,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
Why am I hearing cheering?,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame..."
Im sorry. Thats the one thing I cant do. I promised that Id be with Monica.,"You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldnt, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
Merry Christmas.,Okay!
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.,Thank you?

"No, actually Lauries a boy.",But Jos got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Stop what?!,"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date kinda thing.","Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we dont even know if hes gonna propose."

"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch. _B_","Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club."

I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in.,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing."

So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!,What?!! What?
Again?,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass.","Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."

"Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? Its over.","Juice, I need..."

But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet."
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.","Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will."

"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.","Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once."

See? Intuitive!,I'm adopted?!
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!,Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]

"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?","Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house."
At least as long as I have the pants.,How long do you want the cuffs?
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
"Actually, uh, we're both the father. _B_ Chandler and",I'm him.
"Oh, I couldn't be happier.",So how you two gettin' along?
"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world.",Uh-huh.
"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!",Chandler?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!,"Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the Materhorn."
"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julies",Are you sure?
"Okay, Im going to go stand over there.",I dont get this! She was horrible!
"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?","Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you ladle."" _B_"

Well you did pull his hair.,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?","Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue."
"Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again.","I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?"
Cupping.,What?
"Yes, I am!",You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?
There has got to be a way!,"Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers! Commercial Break _B_"
"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.","We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
90 seconds.,How long has it been this time?
"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.,We are pretty good.
"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I’ll get out of it.","Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
I'm *happily* married.,So? I'm married.
There you go! Someone came!,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
How do you feel about that?,Adoption.
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!,Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
"Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough! _B_",Yeah.
"Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough! _B_",Yeah.
Its gotta be the first one.,"Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister."
"Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",You guys!! Come on!
And thats the only colour that comes in.,"I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we dont do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say lets Ross it!"
Off?!!,We were just waxing our legs.
"Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.","Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler."
"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",It's 430.
"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.","All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen."
"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?",I wasnt sleeping.
"Well, were really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.","Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving."
You remember Janice.,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!"
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",Wow! I could've died tonight.
Not once did we do that.,Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
"I did, but...",Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.",Stop it!
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...,Oh! You have a window!

"Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want. Mr.",It wasn’t fun?!
What did I just say?,But you are a liar.
"oh, honey..","I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.","Okay, you come up with an idea."
"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?","I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.,"Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!"
She's one of us now. _B_,"You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH."
There's another carton right over there.,"Great, well, I'm happy for ya. _B_ Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice.

"All right, bye-bye now!",All right!
Im not getting into this again!,He took my snack!
That is true.,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.","Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"""
Who the hell is Carl?!,"Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
"I can see it now, ""Look dad, its the Sphinx!""",I went to Egypt with my dad.
"Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.","Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
"I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.",Regina Philange.
"Yeah. Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old girl.","Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
Marcel?! _B_,Marcel?
"You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all I did was think about it.
"Im sorry, did you say cheese?",Jeez! What is with you?
What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!,"Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right."
What is wrong with Emma?,Thank you.
"Look, I may not know alot about babies, but you really think I'm not capable?","No, you're all about the fun."
"Right. So, I'm sorry...",Oh. What's *that* like?
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.,What do you think?
Which technically now you should give back!,He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
And that's how you bought it?,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
"God, I love these fingers...",I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... _B_
"Yep, Im in a tree. _B_","Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree."
"Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.","For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience."
You-you do?,"Okay, I see what's going on here."
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet."
"Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. Ticket Counter","On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane."

"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.","Please.. please, we are so close."
"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!",But we love our house.

Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,Then why do you throw like one?
I can do that.,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?"
"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.","All right, whats going on?"
Im kidding. This is going to be fun.,What?!!
"Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa. Ms.","Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa. _B_"
"Ok, so if we both had Emma, and I die _B_ she'd have to give her up.","No...you both are equally capable. It's just that you're strongest, when you're together."
"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this","Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?"
Yeah.,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"

And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me."
I couldnt do it.,"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?"

All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. _B_,I'm gonna do it.
Yeah?,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth."

What?,"Well, now we got a reason."
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.,Huh?
Yeah. Right.,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"

And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
"Aww, I love you so","And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youll be crying a river inside."

But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple ofcigarettes--no big deal.,Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
"So...so let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma, then my wife dies, then Emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?",I lie better than that right?
"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",She's asleep.

What?!,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?","Oh, why is it unfair?"
"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!",What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Tyrannosaurus!,Stegosaurus!
Mazel tov! _B_ Dr.,"Oh, just had a baby."
"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!",Uh huh. Why is that?
Heads it is.,Heads.
No?,No.
A woman's,Who's party is it?
"Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.",Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write. What the hells a matter with you? How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
"Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.","Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?"
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!"
Okay.,"Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Sorry.,Dude!
"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.","Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.",Im pretty sure its gun.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!,Ah whatever! _B_
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!,"Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!"
Yeah. O-okay.,"Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
Thats Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.,What?
"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
"Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, ""Go to your room! You're grounded!""",I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
That's the perfect amount!,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",No you did.
They're out there!,Do you hear something?
I got the time to get to know Julie.,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?,"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?"
"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.","What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?","No, it's-it's Andrew."
Wow! Look at them run.,Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
"Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?","So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
"Come on, tell me.","Well, it doesnt matter what I would do."
Freedom!,Foot rubs for a month!
I know! I know!,"Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.,"Me neither, y'know what-"
Let's go quicker.,"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it."
"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",I didn't finish my five pages.
"Okay, but now see you're crying!",See? It's no big deal.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,Okay.
"All right, let me in.",That's right baby.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?"
What? What?,I thought it was Chandler!
"It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?","Well, what did you have?"
"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man?","What are you doing here, Santa?"
"Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on. _B_","Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah Ooh Oohh Ohh Oh God Ohh Oh Ohh Ohhhh"
"You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money","Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!"
"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall. _B_","But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?"
What?!,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Ok!,"Hey, listen. Call me."
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.,"No, I'll do it."
"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
We have to assign heads to something.,Yes! Whew!
"Alright, hang on a second there Custer.","No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys."
Chelsea.,What woman?!
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,"All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
SoYou got in voluntarily?!,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!"
"Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it?","No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside."
Yeah baby!,"Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King!"
And you're okay with that?,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""","Go on, teach me something about men and women."
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!,"Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going."
Im right here!,"Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler."
"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.",I really wish that you wouldnt.
"Well, I feel like a snack!",I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my résumé! _B_
Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience.,For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!","You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
Oh dear God!,Fine. Shes wearing my bra!
"Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Tell it to the Time Turtle!,"Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!"
You said that to me last week.,Can you hear me say you're grounded?
Wrong number?,"Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye."
"Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!","Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
Fancy.,Everyday use.
New York is awesome!,"Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming."
"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.","Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
"Yeah, okay.",Nooo!
"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",He's... new.
"Yeah, Ill go get one.","They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
"What? What are you, what are you talking about?","All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out."
"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!",Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
"Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once.","Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!"
What?,I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
I do not hate Ross!,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
What?,No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Thanks.,You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. _B_",You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Not 700 exactly?,"Uh, wow, 700."
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!,"Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity."
"So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?","Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",And shes back in the game. _B_
What?,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",I couldn't even if I wanted to. _B_
Howdy doody.,Sure. _B_
"Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.","Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?"
"I dont know, five hundred dollars?","Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?"
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!","I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
What?,Y'know what's weird?
Work people? Nobody told me.,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? End","Oh, thank you."
"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",Hi
"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!","Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? _B_,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
Can I be that guy? _B_,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?"
"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",Where in Cuba? _B_
"Hey, Lowell.","Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Closing Credits _B_"
"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.","Okay, well be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
BEND OVER?!!! _B_,"I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?"
You gotta let me slam the door!,Chandler-
"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.",Oh my God!
"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
It's true.,No way!
"Oh, hey guys!",Hey! Look who I found!
"Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!","Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you."
Pheebs!!,Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Oh no thanks. I dont like anything from my Scottish heritage.,Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
"See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!",Yes!
And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",I look like a man'
That's great!,It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Ross' shirt is torn.,Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Fancy guest.,Guest.
"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.",What is with you?
"If you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.","I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys."
"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. _B_","And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. _B_"
"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.","What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
Yeah! All right! You go first.,Yeah?
"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.","No, that's not exactly what I was.."
"Well, hello!","No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here. _B_"
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?,The Geller Cup.
Hi.,Hello.
Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!,He loves you.
"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",Really?
"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.",My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,I did not!
What picture?,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Double it!,Yeah.
"Yeah, you wish.",Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
"Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.","I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical."
Im still right here!,"Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
"Its a nickname, Ill explain later.",Hello Skidmark.
"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!","Did you bring me any presents, Santa?"
Ross is Batman!,Really?! Commercial Break _B_
"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! _B_",She's bluffing!
"Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.",Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,BingWhats this?!
"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.","Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?"
"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!","Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him."
I know.,This doesn't feel weird!
"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.","No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
"Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.","Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross."
"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",Tell me about it.
"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-! _B_","Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch! _B_"
Im here to see Mary-Angela.,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
So how's it going there in Financial Services?,"Hey, Chandler."
"Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!",Fights over! _B_
Coffee house?,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just _B_,"No! God, would you just calm down!"
Okay.,Okay.
Tickets please! Thats courtside baby!,I dont know!
Again true.,Well that's pathetic!
I'm not a dropper!,"Oh yeah, that's right!"
"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.","Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
No-noReally?!,"Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better."
"Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",What?!
"No, not us Us!","Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
Heres another plan No!,Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra!
Oh come on!!,Id like to spin the wheel!
Nngghhh!!!!!!!,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!","It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? _B_
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat? _B_,Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
In a bad way?,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different."
"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. _B_","No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.","Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
Okay.,"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
You.,So what do you want?
Do you have any beers? Were out of beers.,Hey.
"Okay, good. Commercial Break _B_",Yeah.
"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",Your thinking about my leg arent you?
"Oh, it doesnt matter. Hey, yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come with me?",No.
You put your fist through the wall?,"Im not proving anything. Okay, Im done listening to you. If I hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never wouldve put my fist through the wall!"
"No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!","Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
Hey!,"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. _B_"
"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.","Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."
"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.",Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
I wish I had smoked for my career,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!"
"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!","I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
Next time?,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you."
"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",What?
"Okay, one more time.","Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents. _B_"
I KNEW IT!!!! _B_,"And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .,Paris?
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",Its pretty clear.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
What question?,"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question."
Oh no-no-no!,"No, its a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. Were gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!"
"This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.","Shes right of course not. Honey, get the tape."
Do you want a calculator?,"Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats"
"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...","Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters."
"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?",You're a really good kisser.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.,Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like'' _B_
You think I should?,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are."
"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
"Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.","All right fine, I pick you."
You told him to play the boxer gay!!,"Thanks, any suggestions? _B_"
Wheres Mary-Angela?,"You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....","Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday."
"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.",It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
"No, I ah, I didnt do them.",Bing! You got those numbers for me?
How do ya do.,And Rachel. And thats Chandler.
But you found me!,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
No they didnt! _B_,"Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.","But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.,And this goes for all guys?
It's throwing and catching!,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?","Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No! Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!"
"Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!",Chandler!
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",Of course!
"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",What are you doing?
Why?,I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!
"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?","Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.","Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand... _B_"

Just a little bit of sugar.,"Oh, none for me. Thanks."
"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you.",I'm crying here!!
Really?,"So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight."
"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.","Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I knew you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!"
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!,"Ooh, so close."
"Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way! _B_",Really?

"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads. _B_",Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?!
Really.,I know. That's what I told her.
"No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.","Oh, you forgot?"
God!! What am I gonna do?!,I remember you did.
Dangerous Liaisons.,Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie
Kill me. Kill me now.,"Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"

"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!","No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.,All right.
"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.","Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed."
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,"Ohh, Im sorry."
"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?","I know, Monica told me."
Why?,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
I fear a jury will see it the same way!,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together!
I think we may have really done it this time.,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.","Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!"

I know!,Yes!
Lose the other guys.,Whaddyou mean?
Right.,Phoebe moved out.
"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.","Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
Have you ever been with a woman?,Well that sounds fun too.
I have no name.,"So, youre just Bing?"
Yes that would have made more sense.,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?","And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
"Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!","Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?"

"Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",Thats very funny!
"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?","That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog. _B_"
Its my joke. Ross and,Its my joke.
"Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.","Okay, you watch too much TV."

Oh-ho-ho-ho.,This is from the woman at the bar.

Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,Hmm.
"Yeah, I know.",Because you do.
Oh!,Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?","Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things."
Hey!,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!""

"Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later. _B_",Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Oh.,Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Hey.,Hey.
"Fine, I'll give the suit back. _B_","I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."

Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'","Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too."
"Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman Ive ever known in real life. _B_","Well, I think so."

What is the matter with you ?!?,"Ohh, I love birds."
"Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.","I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnt juice. All juice, okay?"
Joe?,""" by doin it."""
"Actually, I dont like martinis.",How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice martini.
"Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?","You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!"
Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it?,"Uh, in her defense, shes right. I am stronger. I would destroy you."

I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this."
He is?,"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is."
"No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.","Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"
"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",So? Huh? What do you think?

"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .",Okay good.

"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart.

They do?,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss."

"Ross, that was 16 years ago!",You broke the pact!
How's it going?,How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? _B_
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.,"No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy."
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.,"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor."

Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
"To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.","You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?"
Okay.,"Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! Youre okay."
"Uhh, no-no thanks.","Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!"

"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?","Hes right, what she did was unforgivable."
Its Clint! Clint!,"Bye, Gene."
"Oh, will you give me the thing.","Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me."

Why not?,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there."
Then it's okay!,No.

Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,Three!
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?,It's kind of a package deal!
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.",Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.",Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
I'll take that.,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"

"Hmmm, thats very cool.",All right Ill talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.,"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so good."
With extra pulp?,I ah Oh! Ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Oh my God!,No! _B_
"Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?","All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!"
Okay.,Okay!
Thanks.,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here."
Okay!,"Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,Ross didnt scare you?
Now Ive upset you? What did I say?,No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.
Okay! Okay! Okay!,"Ooh, lets open them!"
Of course it is. Wowwhoa!,Its hard for some people!
"Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes",I have to be up in seven minutes.
Not if I kiss you first.,You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.,No-no! No! No! You dont tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Im a soap actor.
Were you just ten seconds later!,Who are you?
Youre going down.,Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",From the tequila factory?
Nooo!!,"Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled!"
No dont I beg of you! The,We can go into detail

They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.,What?
"I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.",That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
That's what I was doing too.,Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!,Are you awake?
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.,"Oh, me too..."
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
Then what?,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
Hi.,Chandler! Chandler!

"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
"Well, I just",Excuse me?

"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cats name?",I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!

"Well, I, I should go in there.",Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding. _B_,Yeah.
Why me?!,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!","No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
Eh! _B_ _B_,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
"Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!","Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",I thought I was something that we both wanted!
"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Monica's grandmother.,Who's that dirty old lady?
"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",You want his yearbook?
"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.","Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?"
"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?",Ow!
She was not good. Not good.,Awful! Horrible!
"Im talking about you. You big, big freak.","Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
No!,Yeah!!
How do you know?!,"Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!"
"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!","Come on, two on one."
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that. _B_"

Too dry.,"Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?"

"Wait, we cant do this. Phoebe and",Hee hee!
Its not all juice! _B_,"Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! Youre gonna throw that juice at me, arent ya?"
"What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!","Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?"

"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",Ooh.
"Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances.

Oh really?,I didn't.
You too.,"Well, you have fun tonight."
"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.","Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy."
I never stopped loving you.,Huh?
"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.","Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
Yeah?,Chandler!
"I, I know. _B_ _B_","It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.",Ill get the hat. _B_

What?,I'll be right back. What was that?
Yeah.,You do?
"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!","Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
Are you all right?,"Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body."
Really?,"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",How good is that?
Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!,"Okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.)"

We need the stuff. _B_,Well you can have the suite if you want. We dont care about where we stay. Were here to celebrate our love together. We dont have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
Which is why you should do it.,Hey! Its your bachelor party.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.",Oh!
What? _B_,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.","Well, thanks."
Hey.,Hey.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
What are you guys doing together?,Hey!
"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.",That's-ah what I suspected-ah. _B_
"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",This is the worst Christmas ever.
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.","What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."

"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.","No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill be. _B_"
But then later that night,Oh.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!,Here it comes. Our first kiss.
"Ooh, I dont know if were there yet. _B_","I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?"

Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.","Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
Oh really!?,No.
Me too.,"Oh, I will."
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?"

"Takin' that with you, huh?",It's really not that big!
Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.,Geez! Are you ready?
"I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you are the reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.",Okay.
"Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!","No, its not just cause Im jealous. I mean Im not, Im not, Im not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats."
Okay. All right.,Will you stop!
"Hey, look, what do you want from me?",Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
What?,"Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my girlfriend anymore."
"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.","Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I..."
"Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",Thats all youre basing this on?
"I think I do! Thank you, Monica.","Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?"
"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! _B_","Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
Hm-hmm.,See?
Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.
But are you sure you can do this?,Thank you.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,But the mess!
"Dont try to sway her. Im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.","Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the most important thing in the world."
Oh my God!,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
Richard!,Who?
"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",How many kids were we gonna have?
That was you!,"Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!"
"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.",Are you okay?
This is ridiculous.,Because you sent away the dog!

You do it!,I dont want to. You do it!
"Okay, look, just do it gently.","Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her."
"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.",Yeah. _B_
That's ok. _B_,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
"So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.",With Carol? Oh.

Yeah me too.,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . ."
"Oh, I don't know, a million?",Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Really.,Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?","My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
"Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!","Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?"
Uh-oh. _B_,Ewwwww!
How do Monica and Phoebe know?,"I have so got it. Theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
"Yeah, all right.","All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out."
Joey's a sex addict.,Thank you!
"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.",Okay.
Okay.,Turn.
"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!",Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No!,Is this movie gonna be my big break?
"Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.","Dude, what'd you have?"
"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?","Whatever Linus, Im opening mine."
"Okay, so you will meet our guys?",All right.
I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,Hey.

Hey!,Yeah baby! _B_
"Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big","Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?"
Because I'm in love with Monica!!,And why not?!

"Really? Okay, so...",I think you're better than you think you are.
That sounds like fun.,"Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi."
ADRIENNE TURNER!!,NO!
I'm not supposed to tell you.,"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?"
"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",How?
"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.","Chandler, what are you talking about?"
"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",Whoa! You had sex today?
"""Big guy?""","No? What happened, big guy?"
"Umm, this is nice.","Aw, God Ross. Oh. _B_"
"Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do.",Wow!
"Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.",That word was swans. _B_
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,"Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
"Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us.","Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?"
I am pretending.,"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
"Oh uh, when?","Yeah, she broke up with me."
Gotcha!,"Oh, Ill get it."
Oh my God!! _B_,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
Coffee in a fight! _B_,I thought you could use the help.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
"All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.","All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful."
"Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",Okay!
"Now, is that never talking about it again?!","Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower."
"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! _B_","Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!"
Oh you knew that. Good!,What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too.
"Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",What else did you think about?
"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!",What?!
"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. Mr.",Thats unbelievable.
Did you do it on our invitations?!,"I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! ""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh oh-oh-oh"

"Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.",Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
What was that?,"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
"Okay, bye! Oh my God!!","Oh, great!"
Monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!",Turn! Turn!
"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!","Come on, we can't let them win!"
Yes.,What?!
That's perfect! That's brilliant!,The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.

Fine!,Will you get us better gifts?
"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.","Okay, Chandler, you go first."
"Okay now it doesnt matter which one you choose, yknow? Its completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.","Yes, Ill meet em."
"Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joeys not here right now, but I can take a message I think. Hes still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thats great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, thats great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers. _B_","Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_"
"No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.",Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its a beautiful ring!
What?,"All right, I I have to ask."
"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.","Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?"
What?,Oh man!

You told us both we could be in the wedding?,I'm not supposed to tell you!
"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm! _B_","Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."
Obviously.,"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us."
"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",Wow!
You still can't stand her can you?,"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler."

"Okay, on three. One....Two....","Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. _B_"
"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?","I know, it is isnt it?"
Then dont leave me!,"Oh! Youre right. Oh God. But, before I can say good-bye, theres something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, its like, I finally understand what Lionel Richies been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my soulmate, and I cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our lives together."
"Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?","So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?"
Why? What happened to him?,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!","Well then, do it better!"
"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?","Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch."
Sorry!,That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
Thanks man.,"No, 19."
Me too!,"Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way things are!"

"Ahh, third base.","My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie."
Sure you do.,"Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding."
"I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down","Chandler, what were you thinking?"
"Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir. _B_ Soothing male",I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.

"So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!",Not on the ones we sent out.

"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?",No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
"Sure. My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about","Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see ""Philosopher wanted?"""
"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.","Well no, but um."
"Alright, we're gettin' closer.",Mailbox.
So I got ya something. _B_,"No, we're alright."
I'm not fine. Here she comes.,All right.
"No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?",Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
And Milton Berle has a,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generations Milton Berle.

"Oh yeah, there-there she is!",She's there?!
Will you marry me?,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
So?,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
"I also said, ""Yes!""","Dude you said, ""No!"""
Thats what you got me?,"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?"
Can I finish my story?!,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
Please tell me you got the message!,Hey!
I cant do that.,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
What?!,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?","So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero."
"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?",Is Joey here?
What?,Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?

I would never lie to get someone into bed.,"Well, we had a little fight."
Right! _B_ _B_,Yeah. Don't do the dance.
You are really frightening me.,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.

Have fun at church-camp!,Okay.
Have fun at church-camp!,Okay.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.,Still doing the screening thing?

Well let's .let's see what everybody thinks of that?,I slept with Monica.
Sure.,"I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?"
"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.",Really?
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!,What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
"Well, what if all my stuff was here?",Then all your stuff would be here.
Whats wrong?,Hey!

Actually Monica and I are engaged.,"Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?"
Hey!,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like..."
"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.","No-no-no, wait! We need something old!"

Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?,"Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense."
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!"
"I am so, so, so, so sorry!","Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnt. Thats why Im here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-thats a no. _B_"

"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.",You seen Sandy?
"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.","No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.","Why, exactly?"

I dont want to say.,"Well, what is the other reason?"
"Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.",Really?
Okay... ..whose turn is it?,It's just a fur ball.
What? Why?,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.

"Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight.","All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!"
"Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go!

So do I.,"No, I want this to happen."
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.,Yeah.
"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?","Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
Me asking is kind of a sign.,Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Oh man!!,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!!"

"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!",Uh-huh.
"Yknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!","Oh, well Im uh"
"Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.","What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!"
Thats the perfect amount!,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.,"I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So youre bald?"
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Here just...take this.,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
Hey. Agency,Hey.
You cant leave! I have your shoe!,"Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now."
"No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching teams.","The game is over, we eat now?"
Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and",What?
Shall I carve?,It's nice that he has someone. _B_
"So, this isn't over?",Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!

Without my toe?! I need my toe!,"It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound."
I'm gonna put on some music.,So do I.
"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.","Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."
I see. Commercial Break _B_,Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
We said seven!,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
"No, no he went for a walk.","Hey, is Chandler here?"
Oh yes! Oh yes!,"Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont! _B_"
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?
Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.,Well you have to because maybe its stupid.

No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and.

Nice try.,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" Im happy all the time!"
"Okay, how long is this going to go on.","Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
Hey!,Eh! Stop it!
Are you hugging the door right now.,I love you!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?,"Oh, very funny. I dont know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up!"

What are you doing here?,Hi. Hi.
You not gonna believe,"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough."
"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",What else did you think about?
Lying is wrong!,"Now, what do you say?"
No problem roomie.,Thank you.
Uhhhaahh.,"No, that means nothin to me. _B_"
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?,"Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it."

"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",No. Nothing. Closing Credits _B_
"All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.","No, I dont."

"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!,"Mon Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyre supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks its at seven."
"Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.","Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
"Yeah, check out the ring.","Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"

"Yeah-yeah, me neither. _B_",No.
Good-good-good-good.,Hey!
How is that ever going to happen?!,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!"
It's up to you. _B_,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something."
"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.",Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Joey!,Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.,Yeah?

Youre messy.,How did you get in there?!
"...I'm, I'm okay.","Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."
"Alright! That is it! This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. Now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. Now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out...But they're very important to Monica...And I want you to apologize to her right now.",Ew! Ew! Gross gross! _B_

Not to mention the cold sores.,"Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus..."
"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",What the hell is that dog doing here?!
"_B_ Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?","Uh, sure, why not."

"Thats a bad duck!!! Howd the thing go tonight, Ross?",Thats a duck.

She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first."

OK!,One thousand...

What?!,Its you. This is yours.
Really?!,Not any more.
That is the exact same thing.,"Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!"

Really? You got us a chick and a duck?,"Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!"
"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!","So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?"
Depends on what you mean by we. _B_,"YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?"
